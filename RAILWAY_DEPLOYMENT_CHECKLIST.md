# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ **Configuration Files (READY)**

- [x] `railway.json` - Properly configured with Nixpacks builder
- [x] `nixpacks.toml` - Java 17 and Maven configuration
- [x] `frontend/nixpacks.toml` - Node.js 18 configuration
- [x] `pom.xml` - All necessary dependencies including PostgreSQL
- [x] `application-railway.properties` - Railway-specific configuration

## ‚úÖ **Backend Configuration (READY)**

- [x] Spring Boot 3.5.4 with Java 17
- [x] PostgreSQL dependency included
- [x] Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
- [x] CORS configuration updated for Railway domains
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] All controllers have `/api` prefixes
- [x] Security configuration allows necessary endpoints

## ‚úÖ **Frontend Configuration (FIXED)**

- [x] All components now use `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
- [x] Hardcoded user IDs replaced with auth context
- [x] API utility file created for consistency
- [x] `serve` package included for production serving
- [x] Proper build configuration

## ‚úÖ **Database Configuration (READY)**

- [x] PostgreSQL dialect configured
- [x] Environment variables for database connection
- [x] H2 disabled in production
- [x] DDL auto-update enabled

## ‚úÖ **Health Checks (READY)**

- [x] `/actuator/health` endpoint configured
- [x] Railway health check path set correctly
- [x] Health check timeout configured (300s)

## üîß **Deployment Steps**

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

**Backend Service Variables:**
```env
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway
PORT=8080
```

**Frontend Service Variables:**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-service-url.railway.app
PORT=3000
```

### 2. Railway Services Setup

1. **Create Backend Service:**
   - Root directory: `/` (repository root)
   - Railway will use `nixpacks.toml` for build

2. **Create Frontend Service:**
   - Root directory: `/frontend`
   - Railway will use `frontend/nixpacks.toml` for build

3. **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Railway will automatically provide database variables

### 3. Deployment Verification

1. **Check Backend Health:**
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/actuator/health`
   - Should return healthy status

2. **Test Frontend:**
   - Visit your frontend URL
   - Test registration, login, and functionality

3. **Verify Database:**
   - Check that data is being saved to PostgreSQL
   - Monitor Railway dashboard for database metrics

## üö® **Potential Issues to Watch**

1. **Build Timeouts:** Maven build might take time on first deployment
2. **Memory Usage:** Monitor Java heap size if needed
3. **Database Connections:** Ensure connection pooling is adequate
4. **CORS Issues:** If frontend can't reach backend, check CORS configuration

## üìù **Post-Deployment Tasks**

1. **Update CORS Origins:** Replace wildcard patterns with specific domains
2. **Security Hardening:** Review and update security configurations
3. **Monitoring Setup:** Configure logging and monitoring
4. **Backup Strategy:** Ensure database backups are configured

## üîç **Troubleshooting Commands**

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Check service status
railway status

# View deployment logs
railway logs --service backend
railway logs --service frontend
```

## ‚úÖ **Ready for Deployment**

Your project is now properly configured for Railway deployment! All the necessary fixes have been applied:

1. ‚úÖ Frontend API configuration updated
2. ‚úÖ CORS configuration fixed for Railway
3. ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
4. ‚úÖ Health checks configured
5. ‚úÖ Build configurations ready

**Next Steps:**
1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Follow the deployment steps in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
4. Test the application thoroughly after deployment
